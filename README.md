# Swift-Student-Challenge-Entry
Hey there! This is my Swift Student Challenge Entry. It is a project that teaches people the basics of genetic algorithms. The main genetic algorithm it is focused on is NEAT or NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.gecco02_1.pdf). After teaching the user, an AI evolves to learn how to drive a car around a race course without any human input.

Screenshots and video coming soon!
